					<p>-<span class="keyword"> HTML</span> controls the structure of the page<br>
						- CSS Controls the style of the page.<br>
						- <span class="keyword">HTML</span> is written in a tree like structure, which the browser reads to form the page<br>
						- This tree like structure is sometimes referred to as "DOM"<br>
						- Each element has an opening and a closing tag<br>

						- Creates a more reader friendly version of the code<br>
						- Makes it more fun to work on, instead of typing lines and lines of unnecessary code!<br>
